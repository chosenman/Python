Here is a cheat sheet for expressions you'll be using regularly:

'^' Matches the following characters at the beginning of a string. Example: '^a' matches 'anna' but not 'banana'.

'$' Matches the previous characters at the end of a string. Example: 'a$' matches 'anna' and 'banana' but not 'fan'.

'[]' Matches any value in a range. Example: '[0-9]' matches '9' and '9s' but not 's9'.

'{n}' Matches n number or more repetitions of the preceding pattern. Example: '[0-9]{2}' matches '91' and '9834' but not '9'

\d and \w \d matches digits. \w matches characters. Example: "\d" matches "8" and "877x" but not "x989"

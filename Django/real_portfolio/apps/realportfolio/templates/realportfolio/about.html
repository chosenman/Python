    <p>
Repetition qualifiers (*, +, ?, {m,n}, etc) cannot be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix ?, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example, the expression (?:a{6})* matches any multiple of six 'a' characters.
